To fully retrain on the new dataset, significant computational power and access to all previous training data is necessary. Instead, with effective continual learning, this naive approach can be improved by only changing what should be changed. An ideal solution would be able to continually fix mistakes, at a much lower computational cost than retraining from scratch, without forgetting previously learned and unaffected information. Such a solution would minimize computational cost, while maximizing performance. There is no inherent limitation on memory in this problem, although it can be limited if not all training data are freely accessible.

(2021) used the customnews benchmark to evaluate how well a lan- guage model trained on news data from 1969 \u2013 2017 performs on data from 2018 and 2019. They find that models perform worse on the newest data, mostly on proper nouns (e.g. \u201cArdern\u201d or \u201cKhashoggi\u201d), as well as words introduced because of soci- etal changes such as \u201cCovid-19\u201d and \u201cMeToo\u201d. They identify a set of 287 new words that were not used in any document prior to 2018. Such new words are inevitable in future texts too. To teach a model these changes they perform updates on the newly arriving data, which gradually improves the performance on the years 2018 and 2019 (a 10% decrease in perplexity), yet at the cost of performance on earlier years (a 5% increase on all previous years). When weighing all years equally, the final model thus got worse than before updating. ", "question": "According to Lazaridou et al.

(2021), were the introduction of new words such as \"Covid-19\" and \"MeToo\" due to societal changes, as well as proper nouns like \"Ardern\" and \"Khashoggi.\" Model updates gradually improved performance on the newer data (2018 and 2019) by addressing these new words, resulting in a 10% decrease in perplexity. However, this came at the cost of a 5% increase in perplexity on all previous years, causing the final model, when weighing all years equally, to perform worse than before updating."}, {"chunk": "Some of the most powerful machine learning models are trained on very large datasets, usually scraped from the Internet.

The topic has been investigated in the natural language processing (NLP) community for many different applications. Initially, fine-tuning on a supervised domain-specific dataset was the method of choice, but recently, with the success of very large language models (LLM), the focus has shifted towards changing only a small subset of parameters with adapters (Houlsby et al., 2019), low-rank updates (Hu et al., 2022a) or prompting (Jung et al., 2023). How- ever, these methods do not explicitly identify and preserve important knowledge in the original language model. This hampers the integration of general and domain-specific knowledge and produces weaker re- sults (Ke et al., 2022). To identify the parameters that are important for the general knowledge in the LLM in order to protect them is a challenging problem. Recent works (Ke et al., 2021) made some progress in balancing the trade-off between performance on in-domain and older data. In the computer vision field, similar work has also been done by adapting CLIP to different domains (Wortsman et al., 2022) and to include personal text and image pairs (Cohen et al., 2022).
