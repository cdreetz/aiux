[{"chunk": "While memory costs (for raw samples) are almost always constrained, computational costs are much less so. Sometimes simply discussing that there is (almost) no additional computational cost can suffice, yet it is remarkable that in more than 50% of the papers there is no mention of the computational cost at all. When it is compared, it is often done in the appendix. There are a few notable exceptions in the survey, which focus explicitly on the influence of the computational cost, either by constraining (Prabhu et al., 2023a; Kumari et al., 2022; Ghunaim et al., 2023) or optimizing it (Wang et al., 2022b). For a more elaborate discussion of measuring the computational cost, see Section 4.1. Together, these results show that many continual learning methods are developed with a low memory constraint, and with limited attention to the computational cost. They are two among other relevant dimensions of continual learning in biological systems (Kudithipudi et al., 2022) and artificial variants (Mundt et al., 2022), yet with the naive solutions of the introduction in mind, they are two crucial components of any continual learning algorithm. In the next section, we introduce some problems for which continual learning is inevitable. They illustrate that methods with a low computational cost is just as well an important setting, yet it has not received the same level of attention.

Real world practice shows us that models are often imperfect, e.g. models frequently learn various forms of decision shortcuts (Lapuschkin et al., 2019), or sometimes the original training data become outdated and are no longer aligned with current facts (e.g. a change in government leaders). Additionally, strictly accumulating knowledge may not always be compliant with present legal regulations and social desiderata. Overcoming existing biases, more accurately reflecting fairness criteria, or adhering to privacy protection regulations (e.g. the right to be forgotten of the GDPR in Europe (Union, 2016)), represent a second facet of the editing problem.

The model editing pipeline (Mitchell et al., 2022) first identifies corner cases and failures, then prompts data collection over those cases, and subsequently re- trains/updates the model. Recently proposed methods are able to locally change models, yet this comes at a significant cost, or model draw-down, i.e. forgetting of knowledge that was correct (Santurkar et al., 2021). Often the goal of model editing is to change the output associated with a specific input from A to B, yet changing the output to something generic or undefined is an equally interesting case. Such changes can be important in privacy-sensitive applications, to e.g. forget learned faces or other personal attributes.
